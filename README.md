# Classification-of-Healthcare-Data
Applied data mining techniques to assign patients with different levels of "risk" (high, moderate and low) using supervised and unsupervised learning methods

# Project Sumamry 
- Implemented appropriate tools and algorithms during the KDD process, combining data manipulation and analytical approaches to improve the quality of the input data.
- Identified data related issues such as outliers, missing data, unreliable data, differences in granularity, and others, and employed an adequate strategy to deal with the problem data.
- Tested multiple supervised learning models to pinpoint the most favourable one. Optimised the parameters and validated the model's performance, before applying it to the test partition
to predict the labels.
- Applied unsupervised clustering algorithms to determine if the different number of health categories formed can clusters.
